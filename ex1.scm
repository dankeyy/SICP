;; The problem with Alyssa's implementation:
;; As we know the default `if` is a special form;
;; meaning even if the interpreter uses applicative order evaluation,
;; the `if` clause short circuits meaning only one operand will be evaluated.
;; in Alyssa's implementation (if of course the interpreter uses applicative-order evaluation),
;; the program will not stop evaluating the third argument causing the program to infinitly evaluate the third argument.


;; ex 1.7
;; problems with current impl;
;; if numbers are small, tolerence of 0.01 is too big (causing a large margin of error)
;; if numbers are big, machine precision is unable to represent the difference.
;;    The best guess will not be within 0.01 to the root hence the program will not terminate
;; solution??
;; So obviously our implementation of good-enough is not sufficient
;; A very simple solution would be to just keep iterating
;; until the guesses don't change anymore, hence we've arrived at the best solution possible.
